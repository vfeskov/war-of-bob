#War of Bob

I was on a train with no internet or movies, so I started making this game to pass the time. I didn't want to use any frameworks since I would have to use internet a lot otherwise, but I got used to RxJS patterns so much I couldn't figure out how to make the game without it.

I finished most of it on that train and then I spent twice the time polishing it.
